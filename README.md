**Industrial Power Control Using Integral Cycle Switching**  

**Objective**:  
Design a power control system to precisely regulate power in industrial applications while minimizing harmonic distortion.  

**Overview**:  
- Developed a hardware-software solution using **Arduino Uno** for real-time cycle control.  
- Key components: zero-crossing detectors, opto-isolators, and TRIACs.  
- Mitigated harmonic distortions to improve power quality and equipment lifespan.  

**Implementation**:  
- Enabled manual cycle control through push buttons with future scalability for sensor-based automation.  
- Demonstrated in both simulation (Proteus) and hardware setups.  

**Impact and Future Direction**:  
The system ensures energy efficiency and safety while reducing environmental and electrical noise. Future plans include automating the system for temperature-controlled applications in smart industrial power systems.
